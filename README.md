# Better Appsâ€”Better Life

Big idea: Web, HTTP and JavaScript are everywhere... and Node has some cool core features... What if the world can be a better place if more developers master Node?

# HTTP/2

It's here.

Really is here

# History of H2

Started at SPDY at Google

---

# Benefits of H2

---


# Multiplexing

^Allows browsers to include multiple requests in a single TCP connection which in turn enables browsers to request all the assets in parallel.

---

# Server push

^Servers can push web assets (CSS, JS, images) before a browser knows it needs them which speeds up page load times by reducing number of requests.

---


# Stream priority


^Allows browsers to specify priority of assets. For example, browser can request HTML first to render it before any styles or JavaScript.

---


# Header compression

^All HTTP/1.1 requests have to have headers which are typically duplicate the same info, while H2 forces all HTTP headers to be sent in a compressed format.


---

# Encryption*

* De facto mandatory encryption

^Although the encryption is not required, most major browsers implement H2 only over TLS (HTTPS).

---

# TL;DR

Old methods of HTTP/1 might not work and might even harm!

^Domain sharding, file concatenation, sprites

# Let's Get Our Hands Dirty

# SSL Key+Cert

```
$ mkdir http2-express
$ cd http2-express
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out server.pass.key 2048
...
$ openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in server.pass.key -out server.key
writing RSA key
$ rm server.pass.key
$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
...
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
...
A challenge password []:
...
$ openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
```

# H/2 and Node

* `spdy` - like
* `http2` - not like
* core `http2` (based on `nghttp2`) - coming! ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/nodejs/CTC/issues/6))

---

# `spdy`

```
npm init
npm i express spdy -S
```

---

```js
const port = 3000
const spdy = require('spdy')
const express = require('express')
const path = require('path')
const fs = require('fs')

const app = express()
```


---


```js
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
    res
      .status(200)
      .json({message: 'ok'})
})
```

---

```
const options = {
    key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/server.key'),
    cert:  fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/server.crt')
}
```


---

```js
spdy
  .createServer(options, app)
  .listen(port, (error) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(error)
      return process.exit(1)
    } else {
      console.log('Listening on port: ' + port + '.')
    }
  })
```

---

# Start

```
node server
```
